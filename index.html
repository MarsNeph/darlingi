<p><pre>Everything you know in the focus 
Live in the moment
Don't have to question why
Listen to the sound of the virus
You can't deny this
Get up and amplify

I want it all
The chemical
The fix that makes me feel
Like I overdose in stereo
And lose control of real
(I can't believe it's real)

Of one mind, of one soul
We unite to write our <strong>code</strong>
So bleed your message at the tone
'Cause we don't have to feel alone
Feel alone
Let's get this fire started
Let's get this fire started

Everything you know in the focus
Live in the moment
Don't have to question why
Listen to the sound of the virus
You can't deny this
Get up and amplify

Between the grey
We medicate
In hypnotic unity
And between the notes
We surrender the host
And become the energy

Of one mind, of one soul
We unite to write our <strong>code</strong>
So bleed your message at the tone
'Cause we don't have to feel alone
More than ones and zeros
Overriding all we know
Redefining the unknown on my own
Melodic overdose
In you I heard a sign
Screaming from in the shadows
Emotions intertwined
Emotions intertwined

Of one mind, of one soul
We unite to write our <strong>code</strong>
So bleed your message at the tone
'Cause we don't have to feel alone
And of one mind, of one soul
We unite to write our <strong>code</strong>
'Cause In the company of hope
We don't have to feel alone
Feel alone
Feel alone
Feel alone

Let's get this fire started
Let's get this fire started

Everything you know in the focus
Live in the moment
Don't have to question why
Listen to the sound of the virus
You can't deny this
Get up and amplify</pre></p>
